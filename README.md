This module introduces an extensive social media directive.

Put 'jcMediaBox' as an dependency of your application.

Declare a social media hash object where you would like to use this directive.

If you want to link your facebook and twitter account, feed the following object to the directive:
{
    facebook:"",
    twitter:""
}
